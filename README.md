# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ðŸŽ®
A little Udemy project in python
This is a simple Python implementation of the classic game **Rock, Paper, Scissors**. The player competes against the computer, which makes random choices in each round.

## How the Game Works
1. The game prompts the user to enter their choice from "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."
2. The computer randomly selects its choice from the same options.
3. The game then compares the choices to determine the winner:
   - **Rock** beats **Scissors**
   - **Scissors** beat **Paper**
   - **Paper** beats **Rock**
4. The game continues until the player wins.

## Code Explanation
- The `Choice_list` array holds the possible choices.
- The game continuously asks for the playerâ€™s choice until a valid input is entered.
- The computer selects its choice randomly from `Choice_list`.
- Conditions determine whether the player wins, loses, or if it's a draw, displaying the appropriate message.
